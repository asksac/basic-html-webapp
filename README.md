# Basic HTML webapp template

This is a basic HTML webapp template, based on the popular Bootstrap framework. 

## Download and Installation

To begin using this template, choose one of the following options to get started:
* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/asksac/basic-html-webapp.git`
* Run npm install: `npm install basic-html-webapp`
* Execute build: `npm run build`
* Build Docker image: `docker build -t 'basic-html-webapp' .`
* Upload image to repository: `docker push basic-html-webapp:latest` 


## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
